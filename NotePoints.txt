Points For The React Assignment ::
	1. Here Firebase is used instead of json server already asked same to Ayush.
	2. For Login Currently Admin is allowed to Login There. (id :: admin and password :: admin)
	3. As per my assumption from assignment is that any body is allowded to view product and add it into cart but for purchase, login should be required.
	4. It is avialble on http://nav-shopnix-mob.surge.sh/
	5. Nessary Api Call to view Jsons Are ::
		5.1 :: Main API => https://react-shopnix-mobile-store.firebaseio.com/
		5.2 :: Products List ==> https://react-shopnix-mobile-store.firebaseio.com/products.json
		5.3 :: Specific Product ===> https://react-shopnix-mobile-store.firebaseio.com/products/prod1.json (prod1) is id of product replace it with other avilable ids to get their detail
		5.4 :: cart List ===> https://react-shopnix-mobile-store.firebaseio.com/cart.json
	6. Other then that in this Project every thing is Customised through css no design library is used in it.
		===> UI Custom Components are available in UI Folder under componenet folder having Model, backdrop, spinner, button etc UI Component used commonly throughout the Application.
